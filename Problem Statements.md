### Task 1

If there are repeated students who watched in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022, how does their engagement compare between the two periods? Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for these groups. Is there a difference in engagement between paid- and free-plan subscribers?

*Paid Plan Students*

| Statistic         | Minutes Watched 21  | Minutes Watched 22  |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Mean              | 33.80               | 273.02              |
| Median            | 26.33               | 40.28               |
| Standard Deviation| 28.21               | 854.58              |

*Free Plan Students*

| Statistic         | Minutes Watched 21  | Minutes Watched 22  |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Mean              | 25.39               | 117.64              |
| Median            | 14.17               | 11.83               |
| Standard Deviation| 26.23               | 468.93              |

### Task 2

Calculate the skewness and kurtosis of students who watched content in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. Consider paid- and free-plan students. Does the result contradict the mean and median values previously obtained?

*Paid Plan Students*

| Statistic         | Minutes Watched 21  | Minutes Watched 22  |
|Skew	              |0.625157717        	|7.065595612          |
|Kurtosis           |	-0.849282209      	|58.4849581           |

*Free Plan Students*

| Statistic         | Minutes Watched 21  | Minutes Watched 22  |
| Skew              | 1.16773938          | 15.06167594         |
| Kurtosis          | 0.360033015	        | 315.7647882         |
